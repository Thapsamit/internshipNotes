# React Native Notes setups:-

- <View> uses flexbox by default 
- <ActivityIndicator> like a loader


# [id].js //  this is a component that's name will be dynamic
  
  
# Nullish coalescing operator in js (??)
  
- expr1 ?? expr2 
  - This returns the expr2 when left hand expr1 is undefined or null
